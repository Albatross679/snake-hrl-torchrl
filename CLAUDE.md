## Project Overview

Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) for snake robot predation using TorchRL. The snake robot learns to approach and coil around prey using a two-level hierarchy: an approach policy and a coil policy, coordinated by a meta-controller.

## Project Reference

For detailed project architecture, physics, and background, refer to `overview.tex`.

## Do Not Modify

- `dismech-python/` — external dependency (submodule)
- `dismech-rods/` — external dependency (built from source)
- `snakebot-gym/` — custom gym environment (modify only if explicitly asked)

## Files You Can Modify

- `src/` — all source modules (behavioral_cloning, configs, envs, observations, networks, physics, rewards, trainers)
- `tests/` — test files
- `script/` — standalone scripts
- `data/` — data files
- `logs/`, `experiments/`, `issues/`, `knowledge/`, `references/` — documentation files

## Architecture

- **Configs** (`src/configs/`): Dataclass-based hierarchical config for env, network, and training parameters
- **Environments** (`src/envs/`): TorchRL environments for approach, coil, and HRL tasks
- **Physics** (`src/physics/`): Snake body dynamics, contact simulation (four backends: DisMech, PyElastica, dismech-rods, MuJoCo), and CPG actuators (`physics/cpg/`)
- **Networks** (`src/networks/`): Actor-critic network architectures
- **Observations** (`src/observations/`): Feature extractors for compact state representations
- **Rewards** (`src/rewards/`): Shaped reward functions for approach and coil tasks
- **Trainers** (`src/trainers/`): TorchRL-based training loops for PPO and HRL
- **Behavioral Cloning** (`src/behavioral_cloning/`): Demo generation, experience buffers, fitness evaluation, and BC pretraining data

## Documentation (IMPORTANT)

Claude Code MUST document **as it goes** — immediately after each change, not batched at the end of the session. Each entry is a **separate file** in its subdirectory. Follow the `markdown-for-project` skill for formatting, frontmatter, and naming.

| What | Where | Naming | When | File Class |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Logs | `logs/` | `<topic>.md` | After any code change that adds, fixes, or modifies functionality | `log` |
| Experiments | `experiments/` | `<topic>.md` | After running a simulation, test, or investigation | `experiment` |
| Issues | `issues/` | `<topic>.md` | When encountering a bug or error (before or alongside the fix) | `issue` |
| Knowledge | `knowledge/` | `<topic>.md` | When capturing domain knowledge or reference material | `knowledge` |
| References | `references/` | `<topic>.md` | When capturing external references or citations | `reference` |

**Threshold for logging:** A change warrants a log if it modifies behavior, fixes a bug, or changes configuration. Trivial edits (typos, whitespace, comment-only changes) do not need a log entry.

## Active Mode ("Stay Active" / Long-Running Tasks)

When the user asks Claude Code to **stay active** (e.g., "keep going", "stay active and fix everything", "run until done"), Claude Code MUST:

1. **Scope** — only address issues related to the current task or explicitly requested area. Do not "fix" unrelated code that appears to work.
2. **Prioritize** — fix errors and blockers first, then warnings, then improvements.
3. **Autonomously iterate** — continuously identify and resolve issues without waiting for further prompts.
4. **Document each resolution** — write a log entry immediately after each fix, before moving to the next problem.
5. **Check in every ~5 fixes** — briefly summarize progress and remaining issues so the user can redirect if needed.
6. **Stop when** there are no remaining in-scope issues or the user asks to stop.
